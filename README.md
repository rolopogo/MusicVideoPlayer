# MusicVideoPlayer
An IPA plugin for playing videos inside BeatSaber

# Usage

Select a song and difficulty and a Play icon will appear in the top right of the main screen. This takes you to the video detail view for the currently selected song. 

To begin adding a video, click search. A list of videos will appear, based on the chosen song's title and author. If these results aren't satisfactory use the refine button to type your own search terms. Select a video and press download. The video will be added to a queue and you can see the download progress in both the detail view and song list.

When the video has downloaded, the preview and offset buttons will allow you to fine tune the video offset to synchronise the beatmap audio to the downloaded video.

In the settings menu you can enable automatic downloads, which will automatically download videos for new songs if the mapper specified a video. Download quality can be adjusted, but it is not recommended to go above Medium. You can also select a screen position from a set of presets.
